**What is RobotRumble?**
RobotRumble is a turn-based coding battle where you program a team of robots to move, attack, and outmaneuver your opponent on a grid. Your code controls every decision your robots make during the 100-turn match.

**How does it work?**
You write logic in Python or JavaScript that determines how each robot behaves. Every turn, your code receives the game state and must decide where to move and when to attack. Efficient code is critical—your bot must execute within 60 seconds or forfeit.

**What's the goal?**
Destroy all enemy robots while protecting your own. Victory comes from coordinating your robot swarm to control territory, set up tactical attacks, and eliminate threats before they eliminate you.

**What makes it challenging?**
Success requires crafting logic that positions robots smartly, times attacks effectively, and adapts to opponent strategies. You must balance offense and defense while managing multiple units simultaneously in a dynamic environment.
